The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after my assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation.

His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the parents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. The villagers apprised me of \\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \\nalong with state government.

In these three experiences, I personal ly felt proud of our \\never vigilant Soldiers, Sailors and Air Warriors performing their  tasks beyond the call of \\ntheir duty even in the most adverse circumstances natural and man m ade. During the last \\nfive years, I had an opportunity to present colours to many regime nts, participate in \\nnumber of passing out parades, meet the troops who were going to undertake  peace \\nmissions and interact with the family members of our Defence F orces. Our Defence \\nForces are in a beautiful mission. When the nation sleeps during night , Members of our \\nDefence teams are awake to guard us and remain vigilant to counte r any threat. The \\nNation cherishes the valour, commitment and devotion to duty of our Defenc e Forces. \\nSimilarly, I had opportunities to interact \\nwith members of our para-military forces, central and state police personnel including \\ninternal security forces who are making immense contribution in au gmenting the safety \\nand security of our citizens under difficult conditions. \\n \\nYouth movement for Developed India 2020 \\nRecently, in Hyderabad, I met a group of citizens who are putting into practice the motto \\nof transforming of our youth into enlightened citizen.

As per the district authorities the impact of the  training on the students is \\nvisible in terms of self-discipline, love for their parents and tea chers shedding of stage \\nfear and recognition of their duties towards the nation. I talke d to Ms. Padma, a student \\nleader from Andhra Pradesh Tribal Welfare School, Nalgonda who relat ed how she \\nweaned her father away from smoking after imbibing the spirit of  the 10 point oath from \\nthe Lead India Training Camp. This gives me an assurance that the  youth of our country \\nare on the right path \\nthrough this mission oriented programme. With the ignited minds of the 540 million \\nyouth below the age of 25, which I consider is the most powerful resour ce on the earth, \\nunder the earth and above the earth, we have to empower the youth through va lue based \\neducation and leadership. \\n \\nConclusion \\nI was touched by the variety of Indian panorama, emotional content of the tune, cultural \\ndiversity and unity of minds in the vast land of ours.

The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after my assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states.

He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the parents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa.

However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity.

      "\n",
      "The speaker appreciated the question and acknowledged it as thoughtful. They assured the questioner that her dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and that they would work to make it a reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker emphasizes the importance of empowering villages to achieve development goals by 2020. The speaker shares their experience visiting a village in Nagaland, where they saw an empowered village council making decisions and taking actions. The speaker believes that if all villages are empowered and connected, they can transform and develop.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker also highlights an initiative by Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, which is providing urban amenities to 65 rural villages, including physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivity. This has led to the creation of employment opportunities, entrepreneurship, and healthcare and education facilities. The speaker sees this as a model for rural development and competitiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker describes the success of a project in Periyar PURA villages, where 1000 self-help groups have generated employment and created entrepreneurs. The project has transformed 200 acres of wasteland into cultivable land, and villagers are now engaged in various activities such as cultivation, bio-mass power generation, food processing, and marketing. The project has also enabled the development of internationally competitive products, with the support of experts from Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO). The speaker believes that similar projects are needed across the country to bridge the rural-urban divide, with an estimated 7000 such projects required.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares two enriching experiences. Firstly, they met with over 6,000 farmers from various states and union territories at Rashtrapati Bhavan, where they showed interest in the gardens and interacted with horticultural specialists. The speaker emphasizes the importance of doubling agricultural production with reduced resources and improving the economic conditions of the nation through the \"Seed to Food\" principle. They express confidence that the nation can increase agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum through partnerships between farmers, scientists, and industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, the speaker recounts a personal experience with Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, a disabled individual who was born without hands and legs. Despite his physical challenges, he was full of confidence and happiness. When asked what he needed, he replied that he just wanted to sing in front of the speaker. The speaker concludes that this encounter taught them that even in the face of adversity, people can find happiness and fulfillment through their passions and abilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares two inspiring stories. First, they describe a person with physical disabilities who has a hidden talent for music. Despite his challenges, he has developed his skills with the support of his parents, teachers, and others, and now wants to share his music with others to inspire them. The speaker notes that this individual's positive attitude and perseverance have allowed his latent talent to blossom.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second story is about the resilience of the people of Jammu & Kashmir in the aftermath of a devastating earthquake in 2005. The speaker visited Urusa village, which was adopted by the Western Air Command, Air Force, for relief and medical aid. Despite severe damage to the school building and significant losses, the villagers showed remarkable courage and determination in rebuilding their lives. The speaker praises the villagers for taking control of their problems rather than letting them control them, and notes that they have become the masters of their fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is reflecting on their experiences of witnessing courage and resilience in the face of natural disasters and calamities. They mention a recent visit to a village where they saw children and villagers participating in a relief operation with the Armed Forces, and were impressed by their bravery and enthusiasm.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker also shares a personal anecdote from their visit to the Car Nicobar Islands in 2005, where they met with tribal council leaders and children who had been affected by the 2004 Tsunami. Despite the devastating loss of life and property, the islanders had taken in the affected victims as their own and demonstrated remarkable courage and resilience.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker also mentions a poem they composed called \"Sea Waves\" which was sung by the islanders, and expresses their admiration for the tribe's ability to challenge and overcome the challenges posed by the sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the speaker mentions their address to the Pan African Parliament in 2004, where they emphasized the importance of connectivity for societal transformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker proposed the concept of a Pan-African e-Network, a project that would connect 53 African countries with a seamless network of satellite, fiber optics, and wireless technology at an estimated cost of $100 million. The project aims to connect 12 universities, 17 super specialty hospitals, and tele-medicine and education centers across Africa. A pilot project in Ethiopia has already been commissioned, allowing Ethiopian students to take an MBA course with Indian universities and African students to receive medical consultations from Indian specialists.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be a message from the President of India, highlighting the country's achievements in various fields. The key points mentioned are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Telemedicine: India is providing one-hour live tele-consultation to doctors in Ethiopia's Black Lion Hospital, showcasing the country's expertise in technology.\n",
      "2. Pan-African network: The President mentions that the Heads of State in all 53 African countries will be connected through the Pan-African network, enabling instant communication.\n",
      "3. Defence: The President expresses pride in the country's Defence Forces, highlighting their bravery, commitment, and dedication to duty. He also mentions the role of para-military forces, central and state police personnel in maintaining safety and security.\n",
      "4. Youth movement: The President mentions a group of citizens in Hyderabad working towards transforming the youth into enlightened citizens through the Lead India 2020 Foundation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the speech emphasizes India's achievements in technology, defence, and youth development, as well as the country's commitment to promoting peace and security in Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is discussing the importance of transforming Indian youth into enlightened citizens. They mention the Lead India 2020 Foundation, which is training thousands of students in Andhra Pradesh, with noticeable improvements in self-discipline, respect for parents and teachers, and a sense of national responsibility. The speaker shares a personal anecdote about a student who helped her father quit smoking after attending a leadership training camp. They conclude that the 540 million youth under the age of 25 are the country's most powerful resource, and that empowering them through value-based education and leadership is essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of preserving India's rich cultural heritage and civilization, while also focusing on achieving rapid economic growth. The speaker expresses confidence that India can become a developed nation by 2020, citing the country's natural resources, human capital, and the dedication of its citizens. The speaker also emphasizes the need for empowering the youth and encourages them to aim high, quoting a famous poem that suggests that anything they desire can come true if they work towards it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker then outlines five key goals for realizing the vision of a developed India by 2020:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Narrowing the rural-urban divide\n",
      "2. Ensuring equitable access to energy and quality water\n",

      "\n",
      "Overall, the speech is a call to action to work together to achieve these goals and create a brighter future for India.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech outlines a vision for a future nation where:\n",

      "* Everyone feels included and secure\n",
      "* The nation is prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful, and happy, with a sustainable growth path.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "President Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam thanks the citizens of India for their support and cooperation over the past five years.

He emphasizes the significance of youth aspirations and the need to empower them to contribute to the nation's development, particularly through the Lead India 2020 Foundation, which trains thousands of students in various districts of Andhra Pradesh, transforming them into enlightened citizens with values such as self-discipline, love for their parents and teachers, and recognition of their duties towards the nation. Kalam shares his experiences and encounters with people who have overcome challenges, including a person with physical limitations who developed a talent for music and performed for him, and a young girl who showed courage and resilience in the face of adversity during the 2005 Jammu and Kashmir earthquake.\n",

He also acknowledges the contribution of members of para-military forces, central and state police personnel, and internal security forces in augmenting the safety and security of citizens under difficult conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, Kalam emphasizes the importance of a youth movement for a developed India 2020, highlighting the potential of the 540 million youth below the age of 25 to be a powerful resource for the country's development, and the need to empower them through value-based education and leadership.\n",
